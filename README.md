## Introduction
As a person who likes foreign languages, I always want to learn new terms from different fields or contexts. However as a more or less lazy person, I really don't want to create Excel files by hand in a manual way. 

So [**terminolator**](https://terminolator.herokuapp.com/) will help you to end this cumbersome process. Automation is future, we should embrace it rather than pushing it away. 

## Requirements
**None**. This web project is developed specially for an easier UX. So feel free to just use it without prior knowledge of technical terms. 

## Developer's Notes
### Feedbacks
As a software developer, I value feedbacks whether they are negative or positive feedbacks. So please feel free to speak out your thoughts. You can always contact me from [here](mailto:atakanzzengin@gmail.com)
### Notice
Currently the application accepts files with `.txt` extension only. I'll make improvements about file formats soon, so you wouldn't have to transfer your texts to another file. 

Finally, I **strongly** recommend you to **revise your terminologies** since there might be some mistakes. So please be sure to read your source text and check your terminology.

Use it to save time. Enjoy it.
